## Overview and Origin
Shakepay
Incorporated in 2015
Founders: CEO: Jean Amiouny  CTO: Roy Breidi
Shakepay launched in 2015 after going through a VC accelerator called “BoostVC” in Silicon Valley. In an interview with Protocol Magazine the CEO recounted how he and the CTO got the idea for the startup at a bar in Montreal after wanting to pay for his beer in Bitcoin and being rejected by the server. The original idea for the company was to provide Canadians with a card that they could load with Bitcoin and then use at retail stores making it the first of its kind in Canada. However the company pivoted significantly in 2018 by launching a mobile app and becoming an exchange after it ran into problems with its partnership with Visa and its issuing bank. The original idea of being Canada’s intermediary between bitcoin and retail spending proved to be one that was ahead of its time.The name of the company “Shakepay” comes from both the colloquial idea of “shaking things up”  and unique feature that it offers: once a day users can shake their phone in order to be rewarded with a small amount of satoshis that is transferred instantly into their bitcoin wallet.
