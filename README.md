## Overview and Origin:
*Shakepay*-
*Incorporated in 2015*-
*Founders: CEO: Jean Amiouny  CTO: Roy Breidi*--
Shakepay launched in 2015 after going through a VC accelerator called “BoostVC” in Silicon Valley. In an interview with Protocol Magazine the CEO recounted how he and the CTO got the idea for the startup at a bar in Montreal after wanting to pay for his beer in Bitcoin and being rejected by the server. The original idea for the company was to provide Canadians with a card that they could load with Bitcoin and then use at retail stores making it the first of its kind in Canada. However the company pivoted significantly in 2018 by launching a mobile app and becoming an exchange after it ran into problems with its partnership with Visa and its issuing bank. The original idea of being Canada’s intermediary between bitcoin and retail spending proved to be one that was ahead of its time.The name of the company “Shakepay” comes from both the colloquial idea of “shaking things up”  and a unique feature that it offers: once a day users can shake their phone in order to be rewarded with a small amount of satoshis that is transferred instantly into their bitcoin wallet. 
On January 20th 2022 Shakepay closed its series A funding round led by QED Investors venture capital firm having raised 44 million CAD. Other participants in the funding round include Golden Ventures, Broadhaven, and individual investors such as Henri Machalani, Mike Murchison, Jevon Macdonald, Mark Macleod, Dan Debow, Farhan Thawar, and several product leaders from Shopify. Shakepay also had previous partnerships with firms such as Boost, who single handedly participated in the seed round,  Box 1, and Bogaroo. They are still planning to continue to series B and maybe even C if need be. 
### Buisness Activities: 
Shakapay aims to help usher in a new era of financial infrastructure in Canada that allows Canadians to interact with the two leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their goal is to act as the main on-ramp for Canadians who want to buy, hold, and transact in Bitcoin by using their mobile application and website. The company does not intend to act as a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or Binance but rather as a self described “Neo” Bank that encourages Canadians to buy BTC and ETH and then remove it off exchange into a self custodied wallet. Unlike other Canadian cryptocurrency companies the Shakepay app is designed to be used as a way for customers to pay each other in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Canadian dollars by using their “shaketag” username to send and receive money. In this way Canadians have the potential to completely bypass banks allowing them to transact for goods and services using the app. With full interac and e-transfer integration Shakpay makes it easy to fund accounts and boasts incredibly fast transaction times which rival traditional banks. This is all part of Shakepay’s larger mission to ensure that Canadians have the ability to partake in “The Golden Age of Bitcoin” by developing the same functions that banks provide but also allowing for new innovative and inclusive financial tools. 
The company's intended customers are any Canadians who want to gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. In an interview with BrainSation Magazine CEO Amiouny said that they have a particular focus on targeting cryptocurrency subreddit users to use the platform because he believes that they spread the word about how good the platform is in an efficient and organic way which does not require any sort of paid advertising. Shakepay boasts over 900,000 users or 2% of the Canadian population and over $6 billion in currencies bought and sold on their platform. 
Shakepay is unique in that they focus on the narrative “not your keys, not your coins” unlike many of their competitors who want customers to keep their funds on exchange. Shakepay encourages its users to buy and remove coins off exchange in order to ensure that users have full control and custody of their funds. They are also the first all Canadian exchange to offer a Visa prepaid card which gives up to 2% in bitcoin rewards back every time the card is used providing a cashback-like program much like a traditional bank would. Additionally they run limited time promotions like “shakepaid” when a randomly selected amount of transactions done on the card get 100% reimburse by Shakepay in Bitcoin. One feature that is designed to keep customers engaged with the platform which has not been offered by any other cryptocurrency company is their “shakesats” program. Everyday users who meet certain referral conditions can physically shake their phone and receive a small reward in satoshis. The program is designed so that users are incentivized to return to the application each day to “shake sats” because the rewards increase in amount for each consecutive day their phone is shaken for up to 200 days. Functions like this keep customers returning to the application and engaged with price action giving Shakepay a competitive edge over other market participants. 
According to Shakepay’s Stackshare they are currently implementing the following technologies: Cloudflare, Vue.js, Animate.css, Bulma, Segment, Gmail, and Intercom. Their Prepaid debit card is also compatible with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and is integrated with Visa’s platform. Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and website security company which Shakepay uses as a content delivery network and mitigation against cyber attacks such as DDoS. Shakepay uses Vue.js and Bulma, both open source javascript frameworks, to help design their front-end user interfaces. Animate.css is another front-end tool that is utilized by Shakepay for designing any animated features that appear on their app and website. Shakepay uses Segment to manage, collect, and secure their customers' data. Intercom is a software company which Shakepay uses as an in-app messaging platform to communicate with customers. The software is implemented in their customer support communications. 
### Landscape:
Shakepay can be classified as a “Neo” Bank making it part of the Digital Banking domain. Although the company does not offer different types of accounts or interest rates you can use the application as a sort of “bare bones” bank if need be. Recently Shakepay launched its Visa Debit Card which is compatible with Apple and Google Pay making it a part of the payments and remittances domain. Shakepay also acts as an exchange for Bitcoin and Ethereum and provides the ability to automate repeated buy orders for people that are looking to dollar cost average into Bitcoin and Ethereum making it part of the Personal Finance Fintech domain.
Over the past 5-10 years there has been an explosion of startups and affiliate companies founded within the Digital Banking domain in Fintech, particularily in regards to cryptocurrency companies. Major trends amongst these new companies include low/zero fee trading commissions, Visa and Mastercard integration, access to the cryptocurrency market, blockchain integration, custodial “hot” wallet creation, mobile application development and Peer to Peer lending, to name a few. There has been a general focus from many companies on offering the same services that traditional banks offer but with a more attractive fee structure. Innovation can be seen in new services being offered like cryptocurrency access/trading, polished and easy to use UX design, and no fee account creation. 
Shakepay can be considered as part of the Digital Banking Fintech domain which also has a slew of other companies that are competing for market share. These include WealthSimple, Paypal, Coinsquare, Coinbase, Newton, Coinberry, Kraken, Binance, Kucoin, Crypto.com, Bitbuy, Bitstamp, Blockfi, Simplii Financial, Tangerine, and KOHO. This list includes both cryptocurrency companies and affiliate companies of traditional banks.
### Results:
So far Shakepay has had a relatively large business impact. Some metrics that can be used to determine business impact are user growth and team growth. In 2021 Shakepay showed an impressive 381% increase in user growth to over 900,000 Canadians. Additionally Shakepay’s team grew from 20 to 70 employees by the end of year, more than tripling in size. Another sign of having a business impact is Shakepay’s coverage in the media. Over the last couple of years Shakepay has been featured by the Globe and Mail, CoinDesk, BitcoinMagazine, Protocol, and many more media outlets. News coverage by reputable sources is a sure sign that a company is establishing itself in the market and displaying a certain degree of business impact in its domain. 
Some core metrics that companies use to measure success in this domain would be things like number of new customers, repeat customers, and total number of registered customers. Amount of volume traded per quarter/year, amount of money raised in funding rounds, and employee expansion rate.  So far Shakepay, as previously mentioned, is showing fantastic metrics which indicate they are growing at a rapid rate. The company has experienced massive customer growth, VC funding, and employee growth.
One thing that Shakepay prides itself on is deposit and withdrawal speed. Compared to other companies such as Newton or even Wealthsimple, Shakepay has incredibly fast transaction times with little to no problems. This very topic was discussed in an interview with the CEO that is pinned on their main website. He explains that Shakepay leverages the e-transfer protocol and has automated a lot of things in their system to get as close to the same transaction speeds that are on the blockchain. They do not use transaction batching which other competitors in the domain use which means that each individual withdrawal happens very fast. Newton is one of Shakepay’s direct competitors and has more coins available to trade, offers limit orders, and covers the first $5 in network fees, all things that Shakepay does not offer. That being said they raised nearly half as much money as Shakepay in their series B ($25 milloin CAD) and is regularly experiencing some sort of funding or withdrawal problems given the large amount of tradable coins they offer. Wealthsimple, arguably the largest Alternative Bank in Canada offers far more financial products than Shakepay such as stock trading, free tax filing, and managed portfolios. Overall they have larger metrics than any other Alternative Bank in Canada and are currently the industry leader.
#### Reccomendations:
I would recommend that Shakepay keep expanding their financial products in order to keep up with their competitors. Shakepay could add the ability to place limit orders so customers can pre-set when they place buy and sell orders. They could offer crypto friendly tax services like Wealthsimple does or list additional coins for trading like Newton. Additionally Shakepay could utilize their Visa card to the fullest potential by offering new and continuous promotions that keep their customers engaged with the platform and using the card. 
Offering limit orders would potentially increase trading volume for Shakepay as customers would have a more robust set of tools to use when trading. More trading volume means more revenue generated through spreads and fees which could then be reinvested into the expansion of Shakepay. With products like a crypto tax service Shakepay could help customers adhere to Canadian tax laws, gain market share from their competitors such as Wealthsimple, and appear to be compliant with Canadian financial regulations. Lastly, by listing new coins and continuing to offer new and exclusive promotions Shakepay can continue to grow their customer base while fulfilling their core mission to bring Canadians into “The Golden Age of Bitcoin”.
My various recommendations would utilize an array of different technologies some of which Shakepay already uses. New promotions for their Visa card would utilize Google and Apple Pay technologies. Building and offering a crypto tax service could utilize multiple different technologies some of which could help Shakepay form new business relationships with companies like Intuit who offer their own tax software for third party companies to use. Cusotmer service channels would have to be expanded when offering a crypto tax filing service as it is well known that filing taxes for cryptocurrency can get very complicated. Utilizing Zendesk, a popular customer support software, would help Shakepay scale with their new tax service and meet the new demands of customers. Building out a more diverse list of coins would require new integration with different Layer 1 blockchain solutions. This would involve creating smart contracts and cryptocurrency wallets that are integrated with newer protocols like Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and Terra to name a few, requiring developers to use coding languages like Rust and C++.
These technologies are appropriate for the ideas that I recommended because they would help to facilitate implementing them. Without the use of new technologies it would be hard for a company like Shakepay to keep up with the cutting edge of the Digital Banking Fintech domain. The Fintech industry overall is an incredibly fast paced and dynamic new industry which requires the implementation of easily scalable technologies in order to keep up with demand. Shakepay has displayed that it is capable of doing so and its future as a Canadian industry leader looks promising.
